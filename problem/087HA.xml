  <p>Yvonne has studied the cost of tickets over time for her favorite sports team. She has created a model to predict the cost of a ticket in the future. Let <i>C</i> represent the cost of a ticket in dollars and <i>y</i> represent the number of years in the future. Her model is as follows:</p>
  <p>
    <center><i>C</i> =2.50<i>y</i> + 13</center>
  </p>
  <p>Based on this model, how much will the cost of a ticket <u>increase</u> in two years?</p>
